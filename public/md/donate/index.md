## You can support RSG Chess just by keeping this tab opened!

We created a way that allows you to help us just by keeping this tab opened. We're using technology familiar with [UNICEF's Hope Page](https://www.thehopepage.org/) (We recommend you to donate there, too!) - using cryptocurrency. Everything you need to do is click the `Start mining` button below!

#### Will that slow down my device?

Our miner powered by [CoinHive.com](https://coinhive.com/) is 100% customizable. You can increase the threads and the mining speed and we'll receive more help at once, or make them low but leave the tab opened for longer time (recommended) which won't affect your device's performance.

#### Is that legal?
Yeah, it's just some Javascript! More information can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/72ly5z/is_coinhive_legal/). /sort of/

#### How much can RSG Chess receive from my session?

From average 30 minute session with recommended preferences (around 10 threads with 70-90% speed) on device with `Intel Core i5 CPU` we can receive around 1/70 to 1/15 of a US cent. That's little bit, but still a thing. And keep in mind that you can leave the tab opened (and turn on the mining) for even days and weeks...

### Let's do it now!
