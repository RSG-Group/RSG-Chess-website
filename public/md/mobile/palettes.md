# RSG Chess color palettes for different chess boards.

For long time RSG Chess has pretty simple UI and a lot of missing cool features. But since version `1.1.0` that started changing! To give you more personalized experience we announced something called "color palettes". The color palettes are way to _change the board colors_ of RSG Chess. Instead of the default set you can use set with your _favourite colors_. Currently there are 4 palettes:

* **"RSG Chess standard"** - brown & beige,
* **"Light blue ocean"** - lightblue & skyblue,
* **"Chess.com green"** - green shades (Used in Chess.com),
* **"Sweety"** - light-red, pink & purple;

> To change the color palettes go to `Settings` using the _gear icon_, click on the "`Select a color palette`" dropdown and select a palette by its `name`.
