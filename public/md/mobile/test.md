# Introduction

We're trying to make RSG Chess more and more open for everyone who is interested. We open sourced every part of the `RSG Chess family` projects, created [chatrooms](http://rsg-slack.herokuapp.com/) and started open testing programs. <br />
We have open [alpha/beta testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) hosted on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.rsg.chess) for up to 10000 testers.

## Why?

By joining the testing program you will receive **more frequent** updates before _your friends_. You can enjoy new great features without waiting for official release. <br /> You can also try to find and report bugs or request new features - we greatly appreciate this help.

> Warning: Some testing versions may be unstable, contain bugs and uncompleted settings. If you wish to receive only stable versions and updates feel free to leave the program. The main purpose of our testing program is to find issues before the official versions.
